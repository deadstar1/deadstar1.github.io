Probably You have experienced a situation which context based XSS payload that composed of javascript command,event handlers and HTML tags such as `<iframe>`,`<input>`,`<form>` are removed by XSS filters, but not the data-* attributes nor input junk. The XSS filters only returns some HTML tag (`<b>`, `<a>` or `<i>` tags ) and its data-* attributes of XSS payload. 


## Unobtrusive scripting support for jQuery

Unobtrusive javascript is an approach of separating behavior or javascript from presentation or HTML, jQuery, a javascript framework uses HTML 5 data-* attribute as a way of passing data into javascript.

Crafted context based XSS payload w/ data-* attribute could allow an attacker to call a limited javascript function. for instance, a data-confirm attribute executes a javascript confirm box.

### Abuse predefined data-* attributes of Jquery

As I said before, javascript and event handlers of context based XSS payload are removed by an XSS filters but not data-* attributes. Lucky there are predefined data-* attributes that we could use.
The XSS filters would be bypassed through the combination of data-method, data-params, data-URL and data-remote, combining These data attributes can send an HTTP Request including its CSRF token to the Origin. Forged HTTP Request, an on-site request forgery.

Just like CSRF attack, The attack can force the user to perform state-changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. But The HTTP request is coming from the same origin.



**"data-url" and "data-remote": Send AJAX request to the given url after change event on element**

```
<input type="checkbox" name="task" id="task" value="1" data-url="/tasks/1" data-remote="true" data-method="post">

```

**"data-params": Add additional parameters to the request**

```
<a data-remote="true" data-method="post" data-params="param1=Hello+server" href="/test">AJAX action with POST request</a>
```

I used `<a>` tag since XSS filters refuses  `<input>`,`<form>` HTML tag, My final payload would be this 

```
<a data-remote="true" data-method="post" href="https://victim.com/change_email/" data-params="post_data_param_its_value">CSRF OF THE WIND</a>
```

When a victim clicks our injected `<a>` tag, the browser sends a POST HTTP request including the CSRF token that changes the email address of victim's account.
